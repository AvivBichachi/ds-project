1,"2. I agree with the overall point that clients don't behave like full nodes. However, there has been quite a bit of discussion about ""light clients"" in the crypto community even going back to the early days of Bitcoin/Ethereum, so i wouldn't say it hasn't been an area of focus.",brian_armstrong,89179,2022-01-08 02:09:50+00:00,Neutral

3,"@BarrySilbert @SBF_FTX @jespow @cz_binance @OneMorePeter @_pgauthier It's a valid point - will see if we can come up with something that doesn't confuse new users. As Bitcoin keeps growing, it's going to make sense at some point (maybe that point is already here). Buying $100 of Bitcoin is such a tiny fraction already.",brian_armstrong,89239,2021-10-25 16:31:09+00:00,Neutral

5,We can do this all with sensible regulation that protects consumers and creates a level playing field if we work together.,brian_armstrong,89255,2021-10-14 18:19:52+00:00,Neutral
6,"Exciting to see - every major fintech company is now doing something with crypto.  Let that sink in for a moment.

And most major social companies (Twitter, Reddit, Facebook). Gaming is next.

8,"2/ America could be losing some of its best talent from this, and it has some parallels to what is happening to successful CEOs in China. You don't get moved to house arrest in the U.S., but it is our own version it, putting something that gets too successful in its place.",brian_armstrong,89279,2021-10-06 04:19:43+00:00,Positive
9,"9/ The biggest lesson I took away from the whole ordeal is that if you believe something is the right path, it's worth speaking up about it, even if it's controversial.",brian_armstrong,89292,2021-10-01 00:02:43+00:00,Neutral
10,"7/ In fact, I would say it was probably the most positive reaction I've gotten from any change I've made in the history of the company, which is saying something. How could something be so negative in the press, but turn out to be incredibly positive with every stakeholder.",brian_armstrong,89294,2021-10-01 00:02:27+00:00,Neutral
11,"If fiat backed stablecoins really become inflation coins (not so stable), then how will we get a coin that is truly stable?

Perhaps something that tracks a basket of real world goods (purchasing power parity) using oracles?

Ideas welcome.",brian_armstrong,89333,2021-09-15 05:58:52+00:00,Neutral
12,"21/ Our door remains open. Hopefully the SEC steps up to create the clarity this industry deserves, without harming consumers and companies in the process. America could really use us all working together to figure this out right now.",brian_armstrong,89341,2021-09-08 03:12:57+00:00,Neutral
13,"Cookie consent notices are really bad regulation - they've littered the web with more popups, wasting all of our time, for something that was not dangerous.

Nice to see extensions coming out which block all of these (just like ad blockers) https://t.co/Mcx3DmRIXc",brian_armstrong,89389,2021-08-23 14:12:31+00:00,Neutral

15,"Diem was really trying to do a good thing - whether it would work or not who knows - but at least they were trying. It's a shame they got so much push back from the U.S. government, which I viewed as short sighted. https://t.co/ibgbHMSF6U",brian_armstrong,89407,2021-08-18 13:49:43+00:00,Neutral
16,"Wonderful parable about quantity over quality when trying something new.

https://t.co/SQS67jVHxm

It's not that quantity is the goal - it's that it actually produces higher quality to iterate fast.",brian_armstrong,89467,2021-07-02 18:20:18+00:00,Neutral
17,"Science fiction is at its best when it explores the frontier of what is actually possible in the coming years with science/tech (without this tether to reality, it becomes fantasy), and inspires us to think bigger/be more optimistic about what we can all do.",brian_armstrong,89498,2021-06-04 18:18:38+00:00,Positive
18,"The wild part is that you never know if you‚Äôre crazy, or everyone else is. The key here is that if your gut tells you there is something interesting, go take some action toward it and see what happens. Only action will produce more information, not endlessly debating it.",brian_armstrong,89575,2021-04-15 16:05:33+00:00,Neutral
19,"...highlights the importance of resilience and ignoring haters when trying to build something new. Nine out of ten people will think it‚Äôs a terrible idea, and be quite articulate explaining why this is to you. This will go on for YEARs.",brian_armstrong,89577,2021-04-15 15:58:49+00:00,Neutral
20,"First #NFT song is live with @davi_US!

This song is about how when you try to build something new, there will be many doubters and haters along the way. Ignore them and trust your gut. Determination is key to innovation (with homage to @elonmusk). https://t.co/SvNhqy0nKg",brian_armstrong,89612,2021-04-08 18:54:02+00:00,Neutral

Mainstream media serves an important function in society holding functions accountable, but when the entire incentive system is build on who can tear something down, there are great stories that will be missed.",brian_armstrong,89641,2021-03-09 19:11:22+00:00,Neutral
25,Using the day off to do some writing/thinking about the future. Good way to clarify thinking is to force yourself to write something down (concisely/clearly) in a few pages.,brian_armstrong,89652,2021-02-16 00:43:52+00:00,Neutral

27,"AML risks here are negligible vs other methods and regs here have a high probability of harming American, including potentially losing our status as a financial hub long term.

Thoughtful regulation should have a hippocratic oath - first do no harm.",brian_armstrong,89674,2021-01-05 07:19:11+00:00,Neutral
28,"It's ill advised and didn't follow proper procedure. FinCEN should revisit in the new administration, engaging with industry, if it still wants to pursue something in this area. It's not even clear they should btw...",brian_armstrong,89675,2021-01-05 07:17:48+00:00,Neutral
