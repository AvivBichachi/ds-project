574,SatoshiLite,2021-10-08,"I realized that here's a chance for Litecoin to do something to help Bitcoin. If we can get SegWit on Litecoin, it can clear out all the FUD and prove that SegWit is safe and a good upgrade for Bitcoin.

Back then the biggest FUD was the anyone-can-spend FUD.",Neutral,-24.07362117220009,16222029488.2,-19090322926.51

I took it as his approval and just got the team together to make it happen. Litecoin launched on Coinbase in May.

And June 9 was my last day, but that was planned 6+ months in advance.
