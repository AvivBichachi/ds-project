8,SatoshiLite,2020-10-13,"@SerranoReyMiami @tortsch Yeah, some people are in Litecoin for the wrong reason. There‚Äôs no company behind Litecoin. It‚Äôs a decentralized currency.

I sold the coins I bought and mined (not given for free) and I announced it. If that‚Äôs bad, you had time to sell at a higher price after you found out.",Neutral,-0.17998122000000016,11415736.61057108,-12289968.79120837
9,SatoshiLite,2020-10-14,"@monerotrader Tari‚Äôs solution is a MW sidechain, which is very similar to our MWEB solution on Litecoin. Like I said, the problem is liquidity of the coin.

12,SatoshiLite,2021-06-09,Exactly. El Salvador is a third world country. Cash is the dominant form of payment. It takes time to get people comfortable to using currency digitally.
