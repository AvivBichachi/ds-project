1,@elonmusk @dogecoin Don‚Äôt forget to merge mining Litecoin at the same time!,SatoshiLite,123323,2021-02-20 09:04:39+00:00,Positive
2,"19/ I hope that clears things up. Merged mining doesn't add any new security threat. If anything, it helps both coins to combine their security budget.

Merged mining has been great for both Litecoin and Dogecoin. And I'm happy to see Dogecoin doing well recently. https://t.co/acmBCvqOMG",SatoshiLite,123346,2021-02-14 10:27:04+00:00,Positive
3,"18/ If you can pull off this attack, you can make money by depositing LTC to an exchange and double spending it. Adding the ability to also double spend DOGE at the same time adds nothing. Re-read the original hypothetical attack and remove the DOGE from it. It's the same attack. https://t.co/LJtUqklysc",SatoshiLite,123347,2021-02-14 10:27:02+00:00,Negative
4,"17/ The only difference with merged mining is that if you have the resources to 51% attack Litecoin, you can also 51% attack Dogecoin at the same time. But what good does that do?

It's not more attractive to attack Litecoin. There's no higher ROI to attack Litecoin and Dogecoin. https://t.co/Vy7JCktXHv",SatoshiLite,123348,2021-02-14 10:27:01+00:00,Positive
5,"16/ The incremental costs are actually more! Pools like LitecoinPool are paying out PPS 155%. This means miners are getting 55% more in mining rewards than before because of the extra DOGE they get with merged mining.

So incremental costs are $23,250 instead of $15,000.",SatoshiLite,123349,2021-02-14 10:27:01+00:00,Negative
6,"14/ So how does the recent increase in Dogecoin marketcap and liquidity affect this 51% attack scenario?

The simple answer is that it doesn't at all. It still costs $100M+ to acquire the hashrate needed to do the 51% attack. That's still prohibitively expensive.",SatoshiLite,123351,2021-02-14 10:27:00+00:00,Positive
7,13/ Litecoin is Scrypt-dominant and that is one of the reasons why Dogecoin switched to merged mining (AuxPoW) with Litecoin in 2014. Litecoin and Dogecoin miners are combining forces to mine both coins at the same time. So it would cost almost just as much to attack Dogecoin.,SatoshiLite,123352,2021-02-14 10:26:59+00:00,Positive

9,"Congratulations Shibes!

Glad to see Dogecoin doing well. Dogecoin and Litecoin have a symbiotic relationship due to merged mining. Both coins benefit from this. With constant inflation, DOGE will actually contribute more over time to help secure both coins as LTC block halves. https://t.co/ameAp7vj9v",SatoshiLite,123369,2021-01-28 19:03:02+00:00,Positive
10,"@bcippa Yes, if merged mined and the majority of miners are doing the merge mining, then the coin is much more secure. Just look at the example of Dogecoin merge mining with Litecoin. Much secure. Wow!",SatoshiLite,123581,2020-08-01 14:56:29+00:00,Positive

14,@MikeD76825829 Dogecoin is merged mined with Litecoin. Many Litecoin pools mine both LTC and DOGE at the same time. So you can‚Äôt double count the hashrate.,SatoshiLite,124437,2019-08-12 20:45:26+00:00,Positive
15,"@MohistMan @HuobiGlobal After a few more halvings, it may be the case that merged mined dogecoins make up a substantial part of the mining reward to secure Litecoin's network. Would be interesting to see that happen!",SatoshiLite,124519,2019-08-05 17:51:51+00:00,Positive

17,"@jimbo_mr @bitcoinization @MLescrauwaet @bitstein Dogecoin already tested that. Security and hashrate went down fast. It became too easy to attack and they were forced to merge mine with Litecoin.

24,"@mrbobarker Well, those miners are getting paid about 30x more from the LTC mining rewards compared to DOGE. So it's hard to argue that they are Dogecoin miners that also happen to mine Litecoin. https://t.co/SA5ujk0GDH",SatoshiLite,126040,2018-05-29 06:26:21+00:00,Positive
