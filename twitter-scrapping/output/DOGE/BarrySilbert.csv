0,@BillyM2k @UFMJA @ClayLambert20 @WayneVaughan i'm truly excited to see what doge can become over time. it certainly is not going away and has one of the most passionate communities. but it is not worth $37 billion. sorry,BarrySilbert,89990,2021-05-30 14:44:35+00:00,Negative
1,@BillyM2k @UFMJA @ClayLambert20 @WayneVaughan bitcoin has both. doge does not. prove me wrong and i'll be a buyer,BarrySilbert,89991,2021-05-30 14:38:05+00:00,Negative
2,@UFMJA @BillyM2k @ClayLambert20 @WayneVaughan why would you possibly think I want people to lose money? I stated my opinion publicly that DOGE was overvalued to potentially help people not lose money. perhaps I’ll be proven wrong. won’t be the first time,BarrySilbert,89994,2021-05-30 14:08:09+00:00,Negative
3,"@ClayLambert20 @WayneVaughan you're being naive. DOGE is the ultimate momentum, gamble trade. once the momentum is gone and the current holders take a bath on the trade, they'll move on to the next one. they'll learn there are many other/better ways to make 10x",BarrySilbert,90001,2021-05-29 19:04:45+00:00,Negative

8,@greg16676935420 truly sorry. you are what is best about the doge community. just assumed everybody in the doge army wanted to light me on fire (and assumed everybody knew that was Elon's wallet). you are a good person,BarrySilbert,90023,2021-05-23 21:02:39+00:00,Negative
9,"@DOGECOINDADDY1 @ChrisAgrios objectively, there are at least 50 other protocols/coins that have more utility and reason to exist than DOGE. the community needs to come to terms with the strong possibility that the price is going way down from here. if it survives, we'll be there to support it",BarrySilbert,90035,2021-05-22 02:22:04+00:00,Negative
10,@DOGECOINDADDY1 @ChrisAgrios i think the best thing about dogecoin is the community; the worst thing is the elon worship,BarrySilbert,90036,2021-05-22 02:13:11+00:00,Positive

12,"@ChrisAgrios @DOGECOINDADDY1 that is awesome to hear. but with all respect, the whole ""dogecoin army"" thing is not helping. focus on development and driving utility and the rest will follow",BarrySilbert,90038,2021-05-22 02:05:55+00:00,Positive

14,@ChloeRavyn @DOGECOINDADDY1 i assure you elon has many more important priorities in life than the price of DOGE. i hope so at least,BarrySilbert,90040,2021-05-22 01:39:48+00:00,Negative
