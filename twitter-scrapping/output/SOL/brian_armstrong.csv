11,"2/ If you believe government solutions are often inefficient, overpromise/underdeliver, and come with unintended consequences, and that personal responsibility mixed with free markets will create better outcomes for everyone, then crypto is a much needed breath of fresh air.",brian_armstrong,89461,2021-07-15 19:26:55+00:00,Positive
12,"1/ All depends on your perspective...if you believe the government should be the solution to people's problems, then the fiat system with its ""controls"" has a lot to offer. https://t.co/JCwhQW9nLT",brian_armstrong,89462,2021-07-15 19:25:07+00:00,Positive
