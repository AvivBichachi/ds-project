VitalikButerin,16304,2020-09-02 02:54:45+00:00,"In a rollup-heavy ecosystem, on-chain gas fees would remain the same, and 465 gwei may even become the norm, but most transactions would be happening inside rollups, where actual fees paid by users would be hundreds of times lower."
VitalikButerin,16305,2020-09-02 02:54:44+00:00,"The better solution is drastic increases in scalability through (i) rollups, and (ii) sharding. Optimistic and ZK rollups can increase capacity from ~15 tx/sec to ~3000 tx/sec by doing most of the transaction processing on layer 2."
VitalikButerin,16306,2020-09-02 02:54:44+00:00,"EIP-2929, published today, would increase gas costs of some particularly sensitive operations, making it safer to increase gas limits. But this would only be a tiny short term mitigation; decreasing fees from 465 to 372 gwei would not solve the problem.

https://t.co/UBdiNVnZNo"
VitalikButerin,16307,2020-09-02 02:54:43+00:00,"However, increasing capacity is hard to do safely. Ethereum nodes are already running near their limits and there is always the risk of DoS attacks that are much slower to process than regular blocks, slowing the chain to a crawl. Higher gaslimits would exacerbate this."
VitalikButerin,16308,2020-09-02 02:54:43+00:00,"Some very rough math from me years ago suggests the elasticity actually is ~1, ie. a 1.17x increase in gaslimit implies roughly a 1.17x decrease in fees.

VitalikButerin,16309,2020-09-02 02:54:42+00:00,So what does work? Increasing transaction capacity. The fee level at which there exist 15m gas worth of willing transaction senders is higher than the level at which there exist 12.5m gas worth of willing transaction senders.
VitalikButerin,16310,2020-09-02 02:54:42+00:00,"And what's the equilibrium? Well, it's the place where people are actually, once again, paying 465 gwei (and therefore the number in the transaction becomes 2325 gwei and the EF/Vitalik now have to pay the 1860 gwei difference instead of using that money to scale ethereum)."
VitalikButerin,16311,2020-09-02 02:54:42+00:00,"Why? Suppose that this happens. Suddenly, when everyone is selecting ""465"" as their txfee, they are no longer *actually* paying 465 gwei, rather, they are paying 93 gwei.

VitalikButerin,16312,2020-09-02 02:54:41+00:00,"Here's a common class of ""solution"" that I hear to the high txfee problem: why not have (the protocol | the Ethereum foundation | Vitalik) just refund 80% of everyone's fees? But if you understand what I said above, you'll quickly see that this does not work."
VitalikButerin,16313,2020-09-02 02:54:41+00:00,"The remaining transactors would see that blocks are partially empty, so if they lower their fees they would still get included. Hence, everyone would start lowering their fees. How low would they go? 465 gwei."
VitalikButerin,16314,2020-09-02 02:54:40+00:00,"Similarly, imagine everyone was sending transactions with 1000 gwei. A bunch of people would no longer find it worthwhile to send transactions, so they would drop out."
VitalikButerin,16315,2020-09-02 02:54:40+00:00,"So what would happen? There would be more demand than there is space, so people would start bidding higher and higher txfees. How high would txfees go until enough people drop out that the remaining users make up only 12.5 million gas? Well, we know the answer: 465 gwei."
VitalikButerin,16316,2020-09-02 02:54:39+00:00,"Suppose we were in a world identical to today, but where everyone was sending transactions with 100 gwei. At the 100 gwei level, everyone who would be sending txs today would still be sending txs, but there would also be many more who are willing to send at 100, but not at 465."
VitalikButerin,16317,2020-09-02 02:54:39+00:00,"First of all, why is the gasprice currently 465 gwei? Why isn't it 1000 gwei, or 100 gwei?

The reason is: 465 gwei happens to be the current level at which demand (the number of transactions people are willing to send) equals supply (12.5 million gas of tx space in each block)."

VitalikButerin,22356,2018-12-10 16:25:12+00:00,@shemnon Exactly this. I think @VladZamfir came up with that originally.
VitalikButerin,22357,2018-12-10 16:24:58+00:00,"@oliverbeige I'd say reduction of fixed costs. The human cost of maintaining whatever system you use greatly outweighs a couple pennies of transaction fees, so the framing that blockchains are this really expensive thing that requires great value to justify it is not really correct."

VitalikButerin,22359,2018-12-10 16:20:23+00:00,"15. Non-financial applications have a leg up over financial ones in one important sense: there is less at stake if they break, so fewer reasons to fear deploying them fairly quickly. So they could be the first applications deployed widely, especially in institutional contexts."
VitalikButerin,22360,2018-12-10 16:18:50+00:00,"14. Centralized servers can decide to change the rules later, they can get hacked, or they can just shut down if the company disappears. A blockchain Merkle receipt, on the other hand, is forever."
VitalikButerin,22361,2018-12-10 16:17:43+00:00,"13. Another interesting thing that blockchains give is the value of permanence. For example, an ERC721 collectible that you hold in your ethereum wallet is ""yours"" in a very real cryptographic sense that would not be the case if it was just stored in a centralized server."
VitalikButerin,22362,2018-12-10 16:16:45+00:00,"12. If layer 1 becomes cheap enough I literally foresee things like receipts of everyday purchases being published to blockchains.

VitalikButerin,22363,2018-12-10 16:15:11+00:00,"11. Computers have become 1 trillion times cheaper, per unit computation, in the last 70 years. Human labor has gotten 2-10x more expensive. So incurring high technical costs to achieve reductions in social costs is at least sometimes a very good bargain."
VitalikButerin,22364,2018-12-10 16:13:37+00:00,10. Blockchains are NOT about cutting computational costs (at least relative to centralized servers). Blockchains are about incurring a sacrifice in the form of INCREASED computational costs to achieve a *decrease* in *social costs*.
VitalikButerin,22365,2018-12-10 16:11:58+00:00,"9. Blockchains of the future with proof of stake and sharding will be thousands of times more efficient, and so the efficiency sacrifices of putting things on a chain will become more and more acceptable."
VitalikButerin,22366,2018-12-10 16:11:00+00:00,"8. Public blockchains have a genuine competitive advantage over both centralized servers and consortium chains in credibly signaling neutrality. Right now it seems like benefits like this might not be worth the costs of public chains, but that's just the public chains of today..."
VitalikButerin,22367,2018-12-10 16:09:57+00:00,"7. There are also many categories of use cases where different applications need to be on a common database, and it's just more convenient (or less risk of capture) if it's a credibly neutral platform. Supply chain tracing stuff theoretically falls here."
VitalikButerin,22368,2018-12-10 16:08:08+00:00,"6. Another category of use cases is verifying integrity of processes. For example, in an auction, you might want to verify that everyone's bid that was submitted on time was included, and no late bids were included. If bids are published to chain, even encrypted, you can do this."
VitalikButerin,22369,2018-12-10 16:05:44+00:00,"5. You can extend this to other contexts. A big one is key revocation in self-sovereign identity. If you have a key A, then you switch to key B, then key A is hacked later, how does someone you're interacting with no key A is no longer valid? Can check for revocations on chain."
VitalikButerin,22370,2018-12-10 16:04:36+00:00,"4. To check that a degree was not yet revoked, you simply scan the chain and check all of the logs of the revocation contract. If a given degree was signed, and the revocation is not found on chain, then that means it's still valid."
VitalikButerin,22371,2018-12-10 16:03:45+00:00,"3. A simple example is a blockchain university degree verification app I saw recently. A degree is certified with just a digital signature, but *revocations* are put on chain. With cryptography alone you can't check that a revocation was *not* signed; but with a blockchain...."
VitalikButerin,22372,2018-12-10 16:01:57+00:00,"2. One underappreciated way to view blockchains is as an extension of cryptography that does different things. Cryptography allows you to encrypt data, prove data was signed by someone, etc etc.... blockchains OTOH allow you to prove that a piece of data was *not* published."
VitalikButerin,22373,2018-12-10 15:59:49+00:00,"1. Time for a brief tweetstorm on non-financial applications of blockchains. As blockchain scalability gets better and better, and UX improves and fees drop as a result, this will become a bigger and bigger part of the story."

* Bound griefing factor to ~2

On the CBC side, much of the same. Onward and upward!"
VitalikButerin,23358,2018-08-16 01:48:31+00:00,"74. The long-run goal of this research is to reduce reliance on the social layer as much as possible, and maximizing the cost of destabilizing the chain enough so that reverting to the social layer is necessary."
VitalikButerin,23359,2018-08-16 01:47:07+00:00,"73. Basically, if a 51% coalition starts censoring blocks, other validators and clients can detect that this is happening, and use the 99% fault tolerant consensus to agree that this is happening, and coordinate a minority fork."
VitalikButerin,23360,2018-08-16 01:46:51+00:00,"72. The network latency assumptions arguably make this unsuitable as a primary consensus algorithm. However, there is one use case where it works *really* well: as a substitute for suspicion scores for 51% censorship detection."
VitalikButerin,23361,2018-08-16 01:46:35+00:00,"71. Also, I recently decided to look into Leslie Lamport's old 1982 paper, where he had a consensus algorithm that has 99% fault tolerance if you add the assumption that all nodes, including observers, are online with low network latency: https://t.co/PnDBzRRT9w"
VitalikButerin,23362,2018-08-16 01:46:24+00:00,"70. In the meantime, a *lot* of progress on verifiable delay functions has been made: https://t.co/XsRUmZH2ap"
VitalikButerin,23363,2018-08-16 01:46:12+00:00,"69. The main tradeoff between FFG and CBC is that CBC seems to have nicer theoretical properties, but FFG seems to be easier to implement."
VitalikButerin,23364,2018-08-16 01:45:56+00:00,"68. The most recent development of all is a result that latest message driven GHOST may, due to a technicality, only give 25% fault tolerance within two rounds, but immediate driven message GHOST (with FFG or CBC) still gives the full 33% (no writeup yet)"
VitalikButerin,23365,2018-08-16 01:45:36+00:00,"67. ...and that it has a very important ""stability"" property: that the fork choice is a good prediction of the future fork choice. This seems obvious, but is very easy to accidentally make fork choice rules that do *not* have this property."
VitalikButerin,23366,2018-08-16 01:45:11+00:00,"66. I was very happy that the RPJ fork choice rule (which I have since renamed ""immediate message-driven GHOST"") is nicely compatible with Casper FFG in a way that most others are not..."
VitalikButerin,23367,2018-08-16 01:44:58+00:00,"65. Around this time I also managed to come up with a way to ""pipeline"" Casper FFG, reducing time-to-finality from 2.5 epochs to the theoretically optimal 2 epochs: https://t.co/0eutcy7Rhp"
VitalikButerin,23368,2018-08-16 01:44:40+00:00,"64. Vlad was very happy, though not fully: he preferred a version of GHOST based on validators' *latest messages*, whereas I preferred a version based on *immediate* messages: https://t.co/Q8rBq6bcoC"
VitalikButerin,23369,2018-08-16 01:44:22+00:00,"63. ... and myself by making a major concession to the Cult of Vlad™, using GHOST-based fork choice rules to greatly reduce the dependence on proposers, allowing the chain to grow uninterrupted even if &gt;90% of proposers are malicious, as long as &gt;50% of attesters are friendly."
VitalikButerin,23370,2018-08-16 01:44:03+00:00,"62. Justin Drake and I went off to solve this problem in two ways, Justin by using verifiable delay functions which have a deterministic and verifiable output, but take a large amount of unparallelizable sequential time to compute, making manipulation ahead of time impossible..."
VitalikButerin,23371,2018-08-16 01:43:46+00:00,"61. This was undesirable, primarily because it required us to have a strong source of on-chain random number generation to fairly pick the proposers. And on-chain randomness is *hard*, with simple approaches like RANDAO looking more and more problematic (https://t.co/ZaW2itzq2o)."
VitalikButerin,23372,2018-08-16 01:43:32+00:00,"60. However, all of these approaches to the fork choice rule had a weakness: they split up validators into ""attesters"" and ""proposers"", and the proposers, being the key drivers of block production, had outsized power."
VitalikButerin,23373,2018-08-16 01:43:12+00:00,59. Here were my initial attempts: https://t.co/1Ly657GTDm https://t.co/PHag5oNMxw
VitalikButerin,23374,2018-08-16 01:43:04+00:00,"58. ...but I wanted to try to take advantage of all of these extra signatures to make the chain much more ""stable"", getting ""100 confirmations"" worth of security within a few seconds."
VitalikButerin,23375,2018-08-16 01:42:45+00:00,"57. Casper FFG (and CBC) both require the *entire* validator set to vote in every ""epoch"" to finalize blocks, meaning there would be tens to hundreds of signatures coming in every second. BLS signature aggregation makes this practical in terms of computational overhead..."
VitalikButerin,23376,2018-08-16 01:42:14+00:00,56. The switch to full proof of stake led me to start thinking much harder about proof of stake fork choice rules.
VitalikButerin,23377,2018-08-16 01:41:37+00:00,"55. In June 2018, we made the fateful decision to scrap ""hybrid Casper FFG as a contract"", and instead pursue full Casper as an independent chain, designed in such a way that integrating sharding would be much easier."
VitalikButerin,23378,2018-08-16 01:41:25+00:00,"54. In addition, the team's work was being split between ""main chain Casper"" and ""shard chain Casper"" and it was clear there was enormous unneeded duplication of effort going on between the Casper and sharding teams."
VitalikButerin,23379,2018-08-16 01:40:58+00:00,"53. Unfortunately, development of FFG then slowed down. The decision to implement FFG as a contract made some things easier, but it made other things harder, and it also meant that the eventual switch from EVM to EWASM, and single-chain Casper to sharded Casper, would be harder."
VitalikButerin,23380,2018-08-16 01:40:32+00:00,"52. In the meantime, Casper FFG was making huge progress. A decision to implement it as a contract that would be published to the Ethereum blockchain made development easy. On Dec 31, 2017 at 23:40, we released a testnet written in python: https://t.co/QbJT89Au7N"
VitalikButerin,23381,2018-08-16 01:39:38+00:00,"51. In early 2018, Vlad's work on CBC started to move forward quickly, with great progess on safety proofs. For the state of progress in March 2018, see this epic two-hour presentation: https://t.co/J3bBJVHm0T"
VitalikButerin,23382,2018-08-16 01:39:14+00:00,"50. But, as is the Ethereum tradition, Vlad and I were both unaware that the word ""ambitious"" can be anything but a compliment, and kept on working on our separate approaches to disincentivizing, mitigating and recovering from 51% attacks."
VitalikButerin,23383,2018-08-16 01:38:47+00:00,"49. It's worth noting here that all of these issues are not unique to proof of stake. In fact, in proof of work, people tend to simply give up and assume preventing 51% attacks is outright impossible, and a 51% attack is a doomsday that must be prevented at all costs."
VitalikButerin,23384,2018-08-16 01:38:33+00:00,48. Vlad (along with Georgios Piliouras) started doing economic modeling to estimate the actual cost of such an attack under his model.
VitalikButerin,23385,2018-08-16 01:38:22+00:00,"47. In the meantime, my main criticism of Vlad's model had to do with ""discouragement attacks"", where attackers could credibly threaten to make a 51% attack that causes everyone to lose money, thereby driving everyone else to drop out, thus dominating the chain at near-zero cost"
VitalikButerin,23386,2018-08-16 01:37:48+00:00,"46. Here is one of my earlier ideas: https://t.co/Kem7zph3ZL . It was something, but still suboptimal; unless network latency was exactly zero, there was only a guarantee that clients' suspicion scores would differ by at most delta, not that clients would fully agree."
VitalikButerin,23387,2018-08-16 01:37:19+00:00,"45. Of course, I was well aware that appealing to the social layer to solve 51% attacks was not a very nice thing to do, so I started looking for ways to at least allow online clients to *automatically* detect which chain is ""legitimate"" and which is the ""attack"" in real time."
VitalikButerin,23388,2018-08-16 01:36:54+00:00,"44. In November 2017, the Casper FFG slashing conditions, plus my ideas for solving ""the 1/3 go offline"" problem through a ""quadratic leak"" mechanism, became a paper: https://t.co/41oRHc5jSy"
VitalikButerin,23389,2018-08-16 01:36:37+00:00,"43. Or, in my words: https://t.co/tUSwmLT882"
VitalikButerin,23390,2018-08-16 01:36:24+00:00,"42. There are basically 3 schools of thought on this issue:

(i) Penalize both sides a little
(ii) Penalize both sides hard (Vlad's preference)
(iii) Split the chain into two, penalize one side on each chain, and let the market decide which chain is more valuable (my preference)."
VitalikButerin,23391,2018-08-16 01:35:30+00:00,41. What if you can't tell if blocks stopped finalizing because a minority went offline or because a majority is censoring the minority?
VitalikButerin,23392,2018-08-16 01:34:49+00:00,40. Penalizing uniquely attributable faults (eg. Casper FFG slashing conditions) is easy. Penalizing non-unquely-attributable faults is hard.
VitalikButerin,23393,2018-08-16 01:34:37+00:00,"39. The classic case of a non-uniquely-attributable fault is going offline vs censorship, also called ""speaker-listener fault equivalence""."
VitalikButerin,23394,2018-08-16 01:34:25+00:00,"38. Here, a very important distinction is between *uniquely attributable faults*, where you can tell who was responsible and so can penalize them, and *non-uniquely attributable faults*, where one of multiple parties could have caused the fault."
VitalikButerin,23395,2018-08-16 01:34:13+00:00,"37. At the same time, Vlad and I were both coming up with our own respective schools of thought on the theory of consensus *incentivization*."
VitalikButerin,23396,2018-08-16 01:33:57+00:00,"36. In the initial version of Casper FFG, proof of work would ""run"" the chain block-by-block, and the proof of stake would follow close behind to finalize blocks. Casper CBC was full proof of stake from the start."
VitalikButerin,23397,2018-08-16 01:33:37+00:00,"35. Vlad's initial preference for the fork choice rule was ""latest message-driven GHOST"", an adaptation of GHOST (https://t.co/NSWlrREmss) to proof of stake, and my initial preference was to start off with hybrid PoS, using proof of work as the base fork choice rule."
VitalikButerin,23398,2018-08-16 01:33:14+00:00,"34. In simplest terms, in Casper CBC the finality overlay adapts to the fork choice rule, whereas in Casper FFG the fork choice rule adapts to the finality overlay."
VitalikButerin,23399,2018-08-16 01:33:04+00:00,"33. Note that Casper CBC and Casper FFG are *both* ""overlays"" that need to be applied on top of some existing fork choice rule, though the abstractions work in different ways."
VitalikButerin,23400,2018-08-16 01:32:30+00:00,"32. Hence, the cost of reverting finality can run into the billions of dollars. The Casper CBC and Casper FFG approaches both achieve this, though in technically different ways."
VitalikButerin,23401,2018-08-16 01:32:19+00:00,"31. Finality is a very significant advancement: once a block is finalized, it is secure regardless of network latency (unlike confirmations in PoW), and reverting the block requires &gt;= 1/3 of validators to cheat in a way that's detectable and can be used to destroy their deposits"
VitalikButerin,23402,2018-08-16 01:32:03+00:00,"30. I eventually simplified the minimal slashing conditions down from four to two, and from there came Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget (FFG), which is designed to be usable as an overlay on top of any PoW or PoS or other blockchain to add finality guarantees."
VitalikButerin,23403,2018-08-16 01:31:37+00:00,"29. ... (ii) if a block is finalized, 2/3 honest validators can always cooperate to finalize a new block. So the algorithm can neither ""go back on its word"" nor ""get stuck"" as long as &gt; 2/3 are honest."
VitalikButerin,23404,2018-08-16 01:31:25+00:00,"28. I defined a rule for determining when a block is finalized, and proved the key ""safety"" and ""plausible liveness"" properties: (i) if a block is finalized, then there is no way for a conflicting block to get finalized without &gt;= 1/3 violating a slashing condition ..."
VitalikButerin,23405,2018-08-16 01:31:08+00:00,"27. I managed to simplify PBFT (https://t.co/bvJ0N7PDwq) and translate it into the blockchain context, describing it as four ""slashing conditions"", rules that state what combinations of messages are self-contradictory and therefore illegal: https://t.co/ch1rcaPLLl"
VitalikButerin,23406,2018-08-16 01:30:40+00:00,"26. I eventually gave up on consensus-by-bet because the approach seemed too fundamentally risky, and so I switched back to trying to understand how algorithms like PBFT work. It took a while, but after a few months I figured it out."
VitalikButerin,23407,2018-08-16 01:30:19+00:00,"25. For example, if everyone votes for B, then everyone votes on a block that contains everyone's votes for B, that proves that they support B and are aware that everyone else supports B, and so they would have no legitimate cause for switching to something other than B."
VitalikButerin,23408,2018-08-16 01:29:53+00:00,"24. To detect finality, clients look for patterns of messages that prove that the majority of validators is reliably voting for some block B in such a way that there is no way they can switch away from B without a large fraction of validators ""illegally"" switching their votes."
VitalikButerin,23409,2018-08-16 01:29:36+00:00,"23 ... they have to submit a ""justification"" proving that, in the relevant sense, the new thing they are voting for ""has more support"" than the old thing they were voting for, and so they have a right to switch to it."
VitalikButerin,23410,2018-08-16 01:29:20+00:00,"22. The correct-by-construction philosophy is very different from traditional BFT, in that ""finality"" is entirely subjective. In CBC philosophy, validators sign messages, and if they sign a message that conflicts with their earlier message..."
VitalikButerin,23411,2018-08-16 01:29:01+00:00,21. In Vlad's own words: https://t.co/KYekgT1kQp https://t.co/ctBtFjogBs https://t.co/gVvK1S8mMa
VitalikButerin,23412,2018-08-16 01:28:49+00:00,"20. Vlad decided that traditional BFT was lame (he particularly disliked hard thresholds, like the 2/3 in PBFT and Tendermint), and he would try to effectively reinvent BFT theory from scratch, using an approach that he called ""Correct by Construction"" (CBC)"
VitalikButerin,23413,2018-08-16 01:28:34+00:00,"19. In the meantime, Vlad started heavily researching mechanism design, particularly with an eye to making Casper more robust against oligopolies, and we also started looking at consensus algorithms inspired by traditional byzantine fault tolerance theory, such as Tendermint."
VitalikButerin,23414,2018-08-16 01:27:56+00:00,"18. The odds on validators' bets would start off low, but as validators saw each other getting more and more confident about a block, everyone's odds would rise exponentially, in parallel, until eventually they would bet their entire deposits on a block. This would be ""finality""."
VitalikButerin,23415,2018-08-16 01:27:34+00:00,"17. The theory was that PoW also has this property, as mining is a bet where if you bet on the right chain, you gain (reward - mining cost), and if you bet on the wrong chain, you lose the mining cost, except with PoS we could push the odds on the bets much higher."
VitalikButerin,23416,2018-08-16 01:27:21+00:00,"16. Consensus by bet was an interesting construction where validators would make bets on which block would be finalized, and the bets themselves determined which chain the consensus would favor."
VitalikButerin,23417,2018-08-16 01:27:10+00:00,"15. I went on a big long, and ultimately unproductive, tangent on a direction I called ""consensus by bet"": https://t.co/dIdFX0HCpv"
VitalikButerin,23418,2018-08-16 01:26:47+00:00,"14 ...once a block was ""finalized"", no _conflicting_ block could be finalized without a large portion of validators having to sign messages that conflict with their earlier messages in a way that the blockchain could detect, and hence penalize."
VitalikButerin,23419,2018-08-16 01:26:26+00:00,"13. Now that we settled on deposits and penalties, we had to decide what those deposits and penalties _are_. We knew that we wanted an ""economic finality"" property, where validators would sign on blocks in such a way that ..."
VitalikButerin,23420,2018-08-16 01:25:56+00:00,12. Here's Vlad's retelling: https://t.co/0hZBSzHOOf
VitalikButerin,23421,2018-08-16 01:25:34+00:00,"11. But to us dirty subjectivists, it did not seem like a big deal; you need some trusted source to tell you what the consensus rules of the blockchain are in any case (and don't forget software updates), so the additional trust required by this PoS assumption is not large."
VitalikButerin,23422,2018-08-16 01:24:55+00:00,10. This was anathema to PoW proponents because it feels like a trust assumption: you need to get the blockchain from some trusted source when you sync for the first time.
VitalikButerin,23423,2018-08-16 01:24:42+00:00,"9. We realized that we could deal with long range attacks by introducing an additional security assumption: that clients log on at least once every four months (and deposits take four months to withdraw), and clients simply refuse to revert further than that."
VitalikButerin,23424,2018-08-16 01:24:29+00:00,"8. We eventually decided that long range attacks are unavoidable for pretty much the reasons PoW proponents say (eg. https://t.co/Khczq12nXh). However, we did not accept their conclusions."
VitalikButerin,23425,2018-08-16 01:23:58+00:00,"7. But if the divergence happened long ago (hence, long range attack), attackers could withdraw their deposits, preventing penalties on either chain."
VitalikButerin,23426,2018-08-16 01:22:51+00:00,"6. If the attack chain diverges from the main chain at a fairly recent point in time, this is not a problem, because if validators sign two conflicting messages for the two conflicting chains this can be used as evidence to penalize them and take away their deposits."
VitalikButerin,23427,2018-08-16 01:22:23+00:00,"5. We spent much of late 2014 trying to deal with ""long range attacks"", where attackers withdraw their stake from deposits on the main chain, and use it to create an alternate ""attack chain"" with more signatures than the main chain, that they could fool clients into switching to."
VitalikButerin,23428,2018-08-16 01:22:06+00:00,4. Here's Vlad's retelling: https://t.co/ODnHkHHeWS
VitalikButerin,23429,2018-08-16 01:21:18+00:00,"3. That said, the penalties that I used were very small, only canceling out signing rewards. Vlad Zamfir joined in mid-2014, and he quickly moved toward requiring validators to put down *deposits*, much larger in size than rewards, that could be taken away for misbehavior."
VitalikButerin,23430,2018-08-16 01:20:58+00:00,"2. Ethereum proof of stake research began in Jan 2014 with Slasher (https://t.co/ENIJsun6zn). Though the algorithm is highly suboptimal, it introduced some important ideas, most particularly the use of penalties to solve the nothing at stake problem (https://t.co/CbMXgQt0TI)."
VitalikButerin,23431,2018-08-16 01:20:35+00:00,"1. Today I am going to make a tweet storm explaining the history and state of Ethereum's Casper research, including the FFG vs CBC wars, the hybrid =&gt; full switch, the role of randomness, mechanism design issues, and more."
VitalikButerin,23432,2018-08-15 02:20:59+00:00,"Is there an English word for two words that mean a very similar or same thing but have opposite connotations?

If not, there really should be one."

VitalikButerin,24930,2018-01-25 22:47:01+00:00,@NickSzabo4 I think this is illusory. Most scenarios where conjectured PoS governance requires active intervention are scenarios in which PoW just plain falls apart.

VitalikButerin,24945,2018-01-22 17:12:21+00:00,"So accepting a 1% issuance rate to avoid a 1% chance of attack per year is actually really not that smart a choice to make, at least if your use of a blockchain is for a cryptocurrency to store your value."
VitalikButerin,24946,2018-01-22 17:10:38+00:00,"Though with long withdrawal times and well-designed gadgets (bonded service providers, insurance markets, etc) they can be quite a good security/cost tradeoff."
VitalikButerin,24947,2018-01-22 17:09:35+00:00,"Reminder: if a blockchain fails and recovers, you still have all your assets, unless they were in channels and loss of liveness during the attack enabled an attack on the channel. It's not 100% truly fully yours unless it's on-chain; channels are already a security/cost tradeoff."
VitalikButerin,24948,2018-01-22 17:07:06+00:00,"There are opportunities to improve things with better technology, for example things like https://t.co/Kem7zpyFol can do 80% of the work of social coordination automatically, making it easier to use against attacks and harder to abuse for other ends."
VitalikButerin,24949,2018-01-22 17:04:40+00:00,"After all, minimizing use of the social layer *is* what blockchains are about. But reducing it to zero has infinite cost, and so there are real tradeoffs between minimizing the social layer and minimizing cost."
VitalikButerin,24950,2018-01-22 17:03:12+00:00,"Now the second question. Now that we know 51% attacks are survivable, can we try to estimate the cost of one? I see two main factors:

1. Cost of loss of service during the attack itself
2. Cost of giving the social layer too much power by over-actively using it"

VitalikButerin,24952,2018-01-22 16:59:23+00:00,"Though an important question is, how easy or hard is this? IMO it's much harder in PoW than PoS, and so PoS can achieve the same level of reliability in practice with a higher frequency of attacks, and hence can survive with a quite low cost of consensus"
VitalikButerin,24953,2018-01-22 16:58:04+00:00,"And yes, in either PoW or PoS, this WILL happen. The idea that if a 51% spawn camp attack happens, all $190b of bitcoin's users will just pack up their bags and leave is absurd; way too much incentive to coordinate and try to continue the ledger."
VitalikButerin,24954,2018-01-22 16:56:36+00:00,"In PoS, you can recover from 51% attacks by coordinating a minority UASF, and the community can do this an unlimited number of times, but out-of-band coordination is still required."
VitalikButerin,24955,2018-01-22 16:55:48+00:00,"For example, if a 51% attack on PoW happens, then the attacker likely has enough hardware to keep doing it forever (""spawn camp attack""), so the community has to change the PoW algorithm to ""delete"" everyone's ASICs."
VitalikButerin,24956,2018-01-22 16:54:01+00:00,"To be clear: I define a blockchain failure as any situation that causes the blockchain to not fulfill its basic guarantees that is bad enough and unrecoverable in-protocol, and so requires out-of-band coordination among users to move on."

VitalikButerin,26880,2017-08-13 07:16:10+00:00,@petertoddbtc There's also the various tricks described in https://t.co/MEEY2ZwwPz
VitalikButerin,26881,2017-08-13 07:14:32+00:00,@petertoddbtc It depends heavily on details. I know there are various min difficulty rules in different chains to deal with this.
VitalikButerin,26882,2017-08-13 07:07:43+00:00,"@petertoddbtc One benefit is that it prevents attacker from creating an attack chain which massively reduces difficulty, then DoSing everyone with blocks"
VitalikButerin,26883,2017-08-13 07:00:45+00:00,@petertoddbtc Ethereum does ~0.05-5% per block. So far we're happy with this approach.
VitalikButerin,26884,2017-08-13 07:00:21+00:00,"@petertoddbtc 51% attacker creates 2017 blocks with timestamps one second apart, then retires; this would raise difficulty by factor of ~1 million"
VitalikButerin,26885,2017-08-13 06:57:08+00:00,"@petertoddbtc And the ""why 2 weeks and not 1 day"" I would pin to over-cautiousness, kinda like the 10 min block time."
VitalikButerin,26886,2017-08-13 06:56:47+00:00,@petertoddbtc I would say the best thing about 4x limit is that it makes weird 51% attacks that do timestamp manipulation have less of a lasting effect
VitalikButerin,26887,2017-08-13 06:53:42+00:00,@petertoddbtc What's the question?
VitalikButerin,26888,2017-08-13 06:34:29+00:00,@desantis @petertoddbtc Ethereum can already drop in difficulty by up to 5% per block. And our approach works amazingly; block times are extremely stable.

VitalikButerin,27499,2017-06-09 13:56:07+00:00,@iang_fc Having consensus on state roots directly gives light clients a very good and high-assurance view of what everyone agreed to.
VitalikButerin,27500,2017-06-09 13:54:41+00:00,@iang_fc Because it's just too damn big. And despite that users still want security assurances.
VitalikButerin,27501,2017-06-09 13:52:47+00:00,@iang_fc I find the 'blockchain as data store only' philosophy completely misses this; we CANNOT count on users personally processing entire history
VitalikButerin,27502,2017-06-09 13:51:53+00:00,@iang_fc So the main reason why we have the state root in ethereum is light client friendliness.
