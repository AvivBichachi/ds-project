So SegWit fixes a major issue, increase block size by 2x, and allows for LN to scale Bitcoin/Litecoin even more. It's a win/win/win. When I first heard of it, I was really excited about it activating!"
SatoshiLite,123175,2021-10-08 18:22:11+00:00,"SegWit treats the witness portion different than the rest with respect to block size. So it's effectively a 2 times increase in block size.

SegWit stands for Segregated Witness. It's basically an upgrade that would separate out the signature (i.e. witness) from the transaction."

SatoshiLite,123184,2021-10-08 00:33:57+00:00,"I realized that here's a chance for Litecoin to do something to help Bitcoin. If we can get SegWit on Litecoin, it can clear out all the FUD and prove that SegWit is safe and a good upgrade for Bitcoin.

Back then the biggest FUD was the anyone-can-spend FUD."
SatoshiLite,123185,2021-10-08 00:32:23+00:00,"But for some reason, it was being blocked by miners. Now in hindsight, we know why that was the case.

SatoshiLite,123187,2021-10-08 00:28:34+00:00,"Although I went along with the plan, it kind of rubbed me the wrong way. Litecoin had a much higher global trade volume at the time and was the #2 coin in marketcap.

SatoshiLite,123188,2021-10-08 00:25:06+00:00,"There was a lot of unsatisfied demand. People in the US had no easy way to store and trade these coins. And Coinbase would steal a lion share of the demand if we added the 2 coins to start.

Both Brian and Fred like the idea but they crossed out LTC. They just want to do ETH."
SatoshiLite,123189,2021-10-08 00:22:56+00:00,This was also when Ethereum was starting to get big. So I put together a proposal to Brian and Fred Ehrsam (@FEhrsam) to add both LTC and ETH to Coinbase.

SatoshiLite,123190,2021-10-08 00:21:29+00:00,That changed though in 2016.

SatoshiLite,123232,2021-10-07 17:11:08+00:00,"And it's important for anyone to be able to easily mine the coin. If your miner base is large, your user base is large. And those are the users that will actively push for adoption and help make the coin succeed.

The problem though with these altcoins was fairness."
SatoshiLite,123233,2021-10-07 17:09:19+00:00,These altcoins experimented on different things like faster block times and different mining algorithm. Bitcoin at the time was predominantly mined by GPUs. Tenebrix brought back CPU mining with Scrypt. This is actually very important because miners are the coin's first users.

SatoshiLite,123310,2021-03-04 20:18:22+00:00,7/ The majority of the value of owning a collectible is lost by switching the ownership from the actual collectible to its certificate of authenticity.

SatoshiLite,123311,2021-03-04 20:18:22+00:00,6/ Part of the value of owning a collectible is the prestige to be able to say only I own it and can display the collectible. And no one else in the world can do that. NFT reduces that value to only I own and can display the certificate of authenticity.
SatoshiLite,123312,2021-03-04 20:18:22+00:00,"5/ It‚Äôs definitely worth something. But is the full value of the Mona Lisa transferred to this certificate? I argue definitely not.

Merged mining has been great for both Litecoin and Dogecoin. And I'm happy to see Dogecoin doing well recently. https://t.co/acmBCvqOMG"
SatoshiLite,123347,2021-02-14 10:27:02+00:00,"18/ If you can pull off this attack, you can make money by depositing LTC to an exchange and double spending it.

It's not more attractive to attack Litecoin. There's no higher ROI to attack Litecoin and Dogecoin. https://t.co/Vy7JCktXHv"
SatoshiLite,123349,2021-02-14 10:27:01+00:00,"16/ The incremental costs are actually more! Pools like LitecoinPool are paying out PPS 155%. This means miners are getting 55% more in mining rewards than before because of the extra DOGE they get with merged mining.

SatoshiLite,123351,2021-02-14 10:27:00+00:00,"14/ So how does the recent increase in Dogecoin marketcap and liquidity affect this 51% attack scenario?

The simple answer is that it doesn't at all. It still costs $100M+ to acquire the hashrate needed to do the 51% attack. That's still prohibitively expensive."
SatoshiLite,123352,2021-02-14 10:26:59+00:00,13/ Litecoin is Scrypt-dominant and that is one of the reasons why Dogecoin switched to merged mining (AuxPoW) with Litecoin in 2014. Litecoin and Dogecoin miners are combining forces to mine both coins at the same time. So it would cost almost just as much to attack Dogecoin.
SatoshiLite,123353,2021-02-14 10:26:59+00:00,"12/ Whereas, Bitcoin Cash (33% NH-able) and BitcoinSV (40% NH-able) are much much easier to 51% attack. If you can rent the hashrate, then there's no upfront costs and only the incremental costs are needed. That's why it's important for a POW coin to be mining algorithm dominant. https://t.co/8azgCCInGM"
SatoshiLite,123354,2021-02-14 10:26:59+00:00,11/ There's also another way to get the hashrate needed to attack. That is to rent the hashrate. This is what the NiceHash-able percent refers to. Litecoin is 6% NiceHash-able. This means you can rent a total of 6% of the Scrypt hashrate. That's nowhere enough to do a 51% attack.
SatoshiLite,123355,2021-02-14 10:26:58+00:00,"10/ This attack is theoretically possible but not practically possible. Satoshi designed this system such it makes more sense for miners to be honest and mine the coin normally, rather than attack the coin and hurt their investment and mining income."
SatoshiLite,123356,2021-02-14 10:26:58+00:00,"9/ He will also need tens or hundreds of millions of dollars worth of LTC to perform this attack because he has to deposit these LTC to exchanges and double spend them. After a successful attack, LTC price might crash, which makes the attack even less worthwhile."

This is because if he successfully pulls it off, he will destroy the value of his Scrypt miners and won't be able to recoup costs."
SatoshiLite,123358,2021-02-14 10:26:58+00:00,"7/ Depending on which miner (A6+ or L3++) you can find, total costs is between $133M to $151M. This is of course assuming you are even able to find and buy that many ASIC miners. I'm talking 149,573 A6+ or 515,201 L3++! And you have to set up a mining farm with cheap electricity. https://t.co/YySJu9tLIM"
SatoshiLite,123359,2021-02-14 10:26:57+00:00,6/ But it's not actually this cheap to attack Litecoin. There's also the upfront cost that I first mentioned. This upfront cost can  be calculated by figuring out how much money it costs to buy all the ASICs/GPUs needed to match the hashrate that is currently on Litecoin network.
SatoshiLite,123360,2021-02-14 10:26:57+00:00,"5/ This incremental costs can be calculated by calculating the electricity costs to run 51% of the mining hashrate for 30 minutes. https://t.co/HYejqons0V is a useful site to check that cost. We see that right now, it costs about $15,000 to attack Litecoin for 30 minutes. https://t.co/0tjj1QJH59"
SatoshiLite,123361,2021-02-14 10:26:56+00:00,"4/ How much time the attacker needs to mine depends on how long it takes for their victim to trust a transaction to be confirmed. So if the attacker is going to reverse some transactions to Coinbase for example, they would need to wait for 12 confirmations, which is 30 minutes."
SatoshiLite,123362,2021-02-14 10:26:56+00:00,"3/ On the flip side, we have attackers. In order to 51% attack a coin, they need to have 51% or close to 51% of the network hashrate and they need to mine the coin for some time to build up a 51% attack chain to override the honest chain and reverse some transactions."
SatoshiLite,123363,2021-02-14 10:26:55+00:00,"2/ First, let me explain how security works in a POW cryptocurrency. Miners have an upfront cost (cost of hardware like ASICs/GPUs) and an incremental cost (cost of electricity) when mining a coin. To make money, miners have to mine enough coins to cover both costs over time."
SatoshiLite,123364,2021-02-14 10:26:55+00:00,"Since so many people have asked me if this is an issue, I figure I should respond to this and clear up any misunderstanding of how merged mining works and how it affects 51% attack.

SatoshiLite,123674,2020-05-23 13:39:04+00:00,"@cz_binance Price will differ because the token on Binance will be different than the split token on other exchanges. Since you won't allow deposits and withdrawals, that's fine. When you do open up withdrawals, split the exchange book into two."

SatoshiLite,128987,2018-01-18 03:01:04+00:00,@nissanandme Fee is 2 cents per kilobyte of transaction data. Typical transactions are 300bytes. So min fee is less than a cent.
SatoshiLite,128988,2018-01-18 00:35:47+00:00,@cryptoball Min fee has always been decided by developer. Same as in BTC. Min fee is there to block spam. My fee signaling proposal will actually try to do away with dev decided min fee and let miners and market decide.

SatoshiLite,129228,2018-01-06 18:17:04+00:00,"@wsheap @pwuille No, the soft fork will enforce that their signal is the lowest txn they accepted."
SatoshiLite,129229,2018-01-06 18:15:49+00:00,"@pwuille If 99% of transactions pay 0.001 and 1% is paying 0.00001. Miners can choose to not mine those low fee transactions to encourage users not to pay so little. I *think* it will work, but hard to know for sure. Worth testing it."
SatoshiLite,129230,2018-01-06 18:13:05+00:00,"@pwuille Also, at worst, miners just do what they do now. But having their lowest accepted fee rate in the block headers make it much easier for SPV clients to estimate fees by looking at last 100 block fee rate distribution.

This will only use up 5 of the version bits."
SatoshiLite,129231,2018-01-06 18:08:19+00:00,@pwuille It's a way for miners to signal. They can give up some money to try to influence higher fees. This will matter more in the long run when fees are a larger percentage of their rewards.

SatoshiLite,129238,2018-01-06 11:12:54+00:00,I'm proposing an upgrade to Litecoin with a soft fork that will let miners signal their min accepted fee in the block header. This will let a fee market develop without having us decide what the min fee is. Will also make it easier for users to estimate fees. More details later.

SatoshiLite,129736,2017-12-16 22:20:07+00:00,Same reason why Litecoin was not traded on Coinbase until the liquidity existed on GDAX. And this is just the operational aspect. There's also the brand confusion. Coinbase is targeted towards consumers. Having both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash will cause all sorts of issues.
SatoshiLite,129737,2017-12-16 22:01:31+00:00,"They might trade if on GDAX as it can be quite profitable. To list on Coinbase, they would need very good liquidity on GDAX because that's where they source their coins from.

SatoshiLite,135019,2017-03-09 03:55:01+00:00,@gavinandresen it would be irresponsible for us to risk our company on a hunch on which coin the users would value more. Do you agree?
SatoshiLite,135020,2017-03-09 03:53:22+00:00,@BankRunNow @gavinandresen that's for the market to decide. I also wonder why people value Ethereum with censorable transactions more.

SatoshiLite,135022,2017-03-09 03:49:27+00:00,"@jimmysong @LukeDashjr do you mean. 300k SF? To answer your question, yes, if we had to run 2 clients. If same client, then doesn't matter."
SatoshiLite,135023,2017-03-09 03:47:51+00:00,"@shibuyashadows that's always a possibility, but I'm trying to keep this thought process just around the fork and nothing else."

SatoshiLite,135025,2017-03-09 03:43:44+00:00,@jimmysong I don't understand what you mean by a 300m blocksize UASF. Why would users want that?
SatoshiLite,135026,2017-03-09 03:29:13+00:00,"@jimmysong for a fork against UASF, miners have to mine a conflicting transaction that steals from. SegWit output."
SatoshiLite,135027,2017-03-09 03:20:30+00:00,"@jimmysong yeah, compatible hardforks are a bad idea. Exchanges cannot support it if there's any chance of a large re-org."
SatoshiLite,135028,2017-03-09 03:19:16+00:00,"@jimmysong yeah, I can't imagine how we'd support that one. It's also a chain where miners actively attacked and stole coins from users."
SatoshiLite,135029,2017-03-09 03:14:23+00:00,@jimmysong UASF is a soft fork. Know the difference.
SatoshiLite,135030,2017-03-09 03:08:40+00:00,"13/ When and if GDAX does add the BU chain, it would by necessity be listed as BitcoinUnlimited with another symbol like BTU for example."
SatoshiLite,135031,2017-03-09 03:08:33+00:00,12/ This means that whatever BTC is traded on GDAX at the time of fork must be the BC chain. And BU chain is an altcoin that forks from it.
SatoshiLite,135032,2017-03-09 03:08:26+00:00,"11/ Because this block lock-in needs to happen after the fork has happened, GDAX can only start supporting BU some time after the fork."
SatoshiLite,135033,2017-03-09 03:08:20+00:00,10/ The only solution to this problem is for the BU team to release code that locks in a block after the fork has taken place.
SatoshiLite,135034,2017-03-09 03:08:13+00:00,9/ There is absolutely no way I would let GDAX make the reckless decision of supporting BU code as is.
SatoshiLite,135035,2017-03-09 03:08:06+00:00,"8/ Practically how this would happen is if the market values the BC chain more, the hashrate will go towards that chain and make it longer."
SatoshiLite,135036,2017-03-09 03:08:00+00:00,7/ All existing BU transactions will be dropped in favor for whatever is in the BC chain. And GDAX would be on the hook for everything!
SatoshiLite,135037,2017-03-09 03:07:54+00:00,"6/ What this means is that if at any point, the BC chain grows longer (in PoW) than the BU chain, the BU client will reorg to the BC chain."
SatoshiLite,135038,2017-03-09 03:07:48+00:00,"5/ It‚Äôs extremely risky for GDAX or any exchanges to support a BU chain as is. It is unstable, because at any time, it can be annihilated."
SatoshiLite,135039,2017-03-09 03:07:40+00:00,4/ Whereas the current Bitcoin Core (BC) chain will not accept any &gt;1mb blocks in its chain.
SatoshiLite,135040,2017-03-09 03:07:32+00:00,3/ Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) is a compatible hardfork upgrade to Bitcoin. This means that the BU chain will accept an all 1mb-blocks chain.
SatoshiLite,135041,2017-03-09 03:07:24+00:00,"2/ Coinbase/GDAX has not made the decision today because we don‚Äôt know yet. But if it were to happen, here‚Äôs what I would recommend."
SatoshiLite,135042,2017-03-09 03:07:14+00:00,1/ I‚Äôve been asked many times how GDAX will handle a Bitcoin fork. Which will be THE Bitcoin/BTC? That‚Äôs the million dollar question!

SatoshiLite,135269,2017-02-28 00:19:37+00:00,@BitcoinErrorLog i think it doesn't because LN makes possible txns that were previously not possible and LN also settles on the mainnet.
SatoshiLite,135270,2017-02-28 00:16:50+00:00,@el33th4xor this is just temporary. You expects miners to be profit driven in the long run. So this will sort itself out.

SatoshiLite,135482,2017-02-08 19:00:30+00:00,9/ I think this is a much better way to compare cryptocoins. Thoughts?
SatoshiLite,135483,2017-02-08 19:00:01+00:00,8/ A coin with $10M marketcap but only $50k in daily trade volume will have its VWMC reduced to $5M.
SatoshiLite,135484,2017-02-08 18:58:49+00:00,7/ So Bitcoin's and Litecoin's VWMC will be the same as their marketcap because their daily volumes are more than 1% of their marketcap.
SatoshiLite,135485,2017-02-08 18:57:03+00:00,"6/ VWMC = MC * Min(1, VOL*100/MC)"
SatoshiLite,135486,2017-02-08 18:55:03+00:00,5/ Volume weighted marketcap will just reduce the marketcap by how much the trading volume is under 1% of the marketcap.
SatoshiLite,135487,2017-02-08 18:53:40+00:00,"4/ I noticed that Bitcoin/Litecoin volume is consistently a bit over 1% of their marketcap, so using 1% as basis seems like a good start."
SatoshiLite,135488,2017-02-08 18:52:26+00:00,3/ So a coin with $1M marketcap may really only be worth $1000 because the daily volume is only $10.
SatoshiLite,135489,2017-02-08 18:51:09+00:00,"2/ Marketcap is misleading because with low volume, you cannot pull money out of the coin without crashing the price and the marketcap."

SatoshiLite,136007,2017-01-06 10:18:33+00:00,And we can get this and more from SegWit today!
SatoshiLite,136008,2017-01-06 10:15:16+00:00,Why would a relatively safe softfork that includes a bonus scaling bump to help kick the can down the road for lightning networks be bad?

SatoshiLite,136018,2017-01-06 09:12:01+00:00,@_drgo I disagree. Bitcoin will just become something immutable. It's a great store of value and gold 2.0. Still cheaper and easier to move.

SatoshiLite,136033,2017-01-06 08:42:33+00:00,@dagur I don't think a 4MB today is bad if we can do it safely with a SF. SegWit gives us almost 2MB with a SF.
SatoshiLite,136034,2017-01-06 08:41:51+00:00,@dagur idiotic. I'm against HF because of the risks.
SatoshiLite,136035,2017-01-06 08:40:53+00:00,"@digitsu @_drgo Would you be happier if devs set the threshold at 60%? They are more conservative even when pushing ""their own agenda"". good"

SatoshiLite,136048,2017-01-06 08:08:10+00:00,@_drgo @digitsu They would fork off the chain and they won't be bitcoin. They are just stealing altcoins. You can do that today.
