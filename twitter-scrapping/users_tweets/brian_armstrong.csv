brian_armstrong,89172,2022-01-08 02:13:42+00:00,"I don't think crypto is anywhere near this end stage though. We are still seeing a lot of new technology and players enter the space. It's not ""already centralized"" as much as it is ""still using some web2 components""."
brian_armstrong,89173,2022-01-08 02:13:36+00:00,I do agree that all networks tend toward centralization over time. Great book on this https://t.co/4Y07wANw4b
brian_armstrong,89174,2022-01-08 02:13:05+00:00,"As a result, there are a lot of ""hybrid"" web2/web3 apps during this phase of web3 development. That doesn't mean the overall trend is bad though. I think it's great that more and more web3/decentralized technologies are being developed."
brian_armstrong,89175,2022-01-08 02:12:57+00:00,"General thoughts: It's still difficult to build things in a decentralized way (nascent tools), so you are seeing various apps/companies revert to using more centralized web2 techniques when they run into a hairy technical problem."
brian_armstrong,89176,2022-01-08 02:11:48+00:00,4. There are more options than Infura and Alchemy. Access to simple blockchain data will be relatively commoditized. Which is good for decentralization.
brian_armstrong,89177,2022-01-08 02:11:14+00:00,"If a platform is merely a proxy to data it doesn't own, and it turns evil, people will switch. Not owning the data counts for a lot."
brian_armstrong,89178,2022-01-08 02:10:11+00:00,3. I agree there is an overall move toward using platforms. But there is a big difference between using a platform that also owns all the data also (web2) and a platform that is merely a proxy to decentralized data (web3).
brian_armstrong,89179,2022-01-08 02:09:50+00:00,"2. I agree with the overall point that clients don't behave like full nodes. However, there has been quite a bit of discussion about ""light clients"" in the crypto community even going back to the early days of Bitcoin/Ethereum, so i wouldn't say it hasn't been an area of focus."
brian_armstrong,89180,2022-01-08 02:09:36+00:00,"1. For NFTs, some keep their data in IPFS (decentralized file storage) or in the smart contract itself for procedurally generated images. We (as a community) should probably move more to solutions like this over time, since it is indeed more decentralized to build them that way."

Check out https://t.co/ePizF9Tzzl for some early efforts I‚Äôm helping with here.
There is a longevity hub, and overall a goal of accelerating science."

brian_armstrong,89365,2021-08-27 18:59:05+00:00,"17/ At our scale, we don't want to be shipping bleeding edge stuff that puts customers at risk, but we do need to embrace crypto-forward and always be building the future."
brian_armstrong,89366,2021-08-27 18:58:42+00:00,"16/ We've got the resources at Coinbase to be a multi-product company, and we have an awesome culture of really smart, ambitious people who are fun to work with.

brian_armstrong,89368,2021-08-27 18:57:55+00:00,"14/ Finally, crypto talent is unique and needs specialized recruiting, so we‚Äôre hiring a Head of Crypto Recruiting."
brian_armstrong,89369,2021-08-27 18:57:42+00:00,"13/ Small teams can run fast toward ambitious problems, utilizing our awesome infrastructure and resources where it helps, and skipping them where they don't."
brian_armstrong,89370,2021-08-27 18:57:30+00:00,"12/ Third, through our project 10% effort, we are getting a lot more submissions for projects to fund that are crypto forward: for instance DAOs, new protocols, etc.  https://t.co/rMvjzlWmUC"
brian_armstrong,89371,2021-08-27 18:57:04+00:00,"11/ We want to embrace this, and make it possible for any crypto forward person to succeed here (while of course collaborating with all their other colleagues, as one Coinbase - no tribalism)."
brian_armstrong,89372,2021-08-27 18:57:01+00:00,"10/ They may be engaged more broadly in the crypto ecosystem, be advisors to various projects, or just be quirky."
brian_armstrong,89373,2021-08-27 18:56:30+00:00,"9/ Second, we're creating a new career framework for crypto forward employees internally. Crypto forward talent has a different way of working that doesn't always fit neatly in our existing career frameworks."
brian_armstrong,89374,2021-08-27 18:56:17+00:00,"8/ We need to make sure we aren't elitist about it, and help more and more people into the ecosystem as they take their first steps. ""Crypto forward"" is a badge anyone can earn, not an exclusive club."
brian_armstrong,89375,2021-08-27 18:55:36+00:00,"7/ There aren't enough crypto forward people in the world to start with, so the first step is probably to help create more. Anyone can become crypto forward (which is why I like this term better than crypto first)."
brian_armstrong,89376,2021-08-27 18:55:10+00:00,"6/ First, we're creating a crypto education program internally (CryptoU), to train up any employee who want to become crypto forward. For instance, you'll be able to learn how to write your first smart contract or create a DAO while working here, if you've never done that before."
brian_armstrong,89377,2021-08-27 18:54:45+00:00,5/ So how are we doing this?
brian_armstrong,89378,2021-08-27 18:54:35+00:00,"4/ But as we're scaled to meet demand, we have an opportunity to now be much more crypto first culture/hiring wise, which fits nicely with our efforts to embrace decentralization https://t.co/uAUGS2eNkQ"
brian_armstrong,89379,2021-08-27 18:54:23+00:00,"3/ We didn't always have the time to focus on the cutting edge stuff, when we were just trying to keep the existing stuff running. A high quality problem to have, but a problem none the less."
brian_armstrong,89380,2021-08-27 18:54:11+00:00,"2/ As we've grown as a company, we sometimes haven't had the best reputation for being on the cutting edge of crypto. This makes sense - we grew so quickly, that a lot of time went into just scaling and operationalizing the existing products we have, which was existential for us."
brian_armstrong,89381,2021-08-27 18:53:50+00:00,"1/ One thing we're working on at Coinbase is improving our ""crypto forward"" hiring and culture. A couple quick thoughts on this‚Ä¶"

Maybe we‚Äôll see a book on how Coinbase works at some point!"
brian_armstrong,89401,2021-08-19 11:59:05+00:00,"Unfortunately a lot of narratives told by outsiders are wildly inaccurate or, worse, reveal their own biases, such as a goal to tear down the company as a marketing tactic for their book."
brian_armstrong,89402,2021-08-19 11:54:36+00:00,"Coinbase already implements a number of these processes. Others we need to recommit to.

What‚Äôs great about this book is it is a list of best practices told by insiders, instead of trying to tell the history of the company from an outsiders POV."

brian_armstrong,89410,2021-08-11 12:55:31+00:00,Spot on as usual from @fredwilson üëå https://t.co/OgWxCj5WSn
brian_armstrong,89411,2021-08-10 20:47:17+00:00,"12/ We are also backers of @crypto_council which is just getting started, and will be an important resource. Follow them for future updates. There are still opportunities to mitigate this issue in the infrastructure bill, and we are just getting started."
brian_armstrong,89412,2021-08-10 20:45:53+00:00,"11/ At @Coinbase, we will do everything we can to help you ‚Äì and our 60+ million users ‚Äì be heard, and to ensure that government decisions globally are made in a thoughtful way."
brian_armstrong,89413,2021-08-10 20:45:29+00:00,10/ The biggest lesson of this has been that the crypto community is now an incredibly powerful constituent. Almost 80k of you contacted your senators urging them to do the right thing. Everyone in this country who sees the promise of crypto needs to stay engaged and be heard.
brian_armstrong,89414,2021-08-10 20:45:14+00:00,"9/ We need to double down on educating our government on the promise of crypto. We welcome sensible and thoughtful regulation, but it can‚Äôt come at the expense of US innovation, US competitiveness, and US leadership in technology."
brian_armstrong,89415,2021-08-10 20:45:02+00:00,"8/ There is an important lesson here for the crypto community: unfamiliarity with and suspicion of innovation, even among a few policymakers, can be extremely dangerous."
brian_armstrong,89416,2021-08-10 20:44:49+00:00,7/ Someone who uses crypto to buy a cup of coffee or send money to their family should not be automatically subject to surveillance and reporting to the government beyond what we see in traditional financial services.
brian_armstrong,89417,2021-08-10 20:44:38+00:00,"6/ There is much more work to be done in ensuring the implementation of Treasury‚Äôs new authority does not lead to abuse, particularly around protecting privacy. I know Senator @ronwyden is focused on this, as are we."
brian_armstrong,89418,2021-08-10 20:44:17+00:00,"5/  Our goal here is simply parity with traditional finance. We should ensure that true brokers report tax info, but every other crypto ecosystem participant (of which there are many, with new ones being created all the time) are not penalized."
brian_armstrong,89419,2021-08-10 20:44:10+00:00,"4/ Our work with policymakers will continue going forward. There is no question that tax reporting is enormously important, but nonsensical rules that are impossible to comply with don‚Äôt advance that goal."
brian_armstrong,89420,2021-08-10 20:44:01+00:00,"3/ Sens. @SenLummis &amp; @sentoomey deserve special thanks for their leadership too, finding common ground with @UStreasury, @SenatorSinema, @senrobportman &amp; @MarkWarner on the crypto tax reporting language. This agreement should play a central role in Treasury‚Äôs implementation."
brian_armstrong,89421,2021-08-10 20:43:51+00:00,"2/ Senator @RonWyden has been a stalwart in advancing sound tech policy, and he deserves enormous thanks and praise from the American people for his leadership and resolve in pushing for sensible crypto provisions in the infrastructure bill."
brian_armstrong,89422,2021-08-10 20:43:44+00:00,"1/ While the damaging language in the infrastructure bill remains, we all owe Sens. @RonWyden @SenLummis and @sentoomey enormous thanks for their work trying to protect innovation and the future of crypto in the United States."
brian_armstrong,89423,2021-08-09 11:22:08+00:00,"By one measure it is getting harder and harder to get hired at Coinbase:

brian_armstrong,89424,2021-08-06 20:41:13+00:00,"10/ Contact your Senators and urge them to vote for the Wyden-Lummis-Toomey amendment and vote NO on the Warner-Portman amendment. Let‚Äôs keep crypto alive and thriving, we‚Äôre just getting started. https://t.co/gCPISrQSxQ"
brian_armstrong,89425,2021-08-06 20:40:34+00:00,"9/ History will not be kind to any politician who tries to block American's access to new technologies. Americans have a very low tolerance for taking away our rights, and harming economic growth."
brian_armstrong,89426,2021-08-06 20:39:31+00:00,8/ This debate in the Senate started because the govt sees the growing crypto industry as a source of tax revenue. We agree everyone must pay their taxes. There is no debate on this topic. But destroying some of the most exciting innovations in the process is unconscionable.
brian_armstrong,89427,2021-08-06 20:39:18+00:00,"7/ If the U.S. fails to embrace the innovation happening in crypto, it risks becoming a financial backwater, missing out on one of the fastest growing sectors of the economy. Imagine if we had missed out on the internet, and the largest internet companies had been built overseas."
brian_armstrong,89428,2021-08-06 20:39:03+00:00,"6/ Crypto is still in its early stages. Innovators across this country are working to make crypto networks better, enabling new apps like NFTs, smart contracts, and DeFi. These will bring enormous benefits to Americans, and help ensure our place as a financial hub."
brian_armstrong,89429,2021-08-06 20:38:29+00:00,"5/ Our Senators are voting tomorrow on the future of innovation in finance and crypto in America. If they choose the Sen.@MarkWarner amendment, we will see future development of blockchain technology move offshore to countries like China that are currently embracing it."
brian_armstrong,89430,2021-08-06 20:38:13+00:00,"4/ Imagine if the government decided that iOS is OK but Android isn‚Äôt. And that software developers building on iOS can thrive, but Android is outlawed."
brian_armstrong,89431,2021-08-06 20:37:57+00:00,"3/ This is the government trying to pick winners and losers in a nascent industry today, where some new technology is being developed every month. They are guaranteed to get it wrong, by writing in a few exceptions by hand today."
brian_armstrong,89432,2021-08-06 20:37:32+00:00,"2/ Senator @MarkWarner has asked for proof of stake validators to comply with the impossible, but not proof of work miners. Why? It‚Äôs not clear, but we could find ourselves with the Senate deciding which types of crypto will survive government regulation."
brian_armstrong,89433,2021-08-06 20:37:13+00:00,1/ There are a few key moments that define our future. One is happening now in the Senate w/ the infrastructure bill. At the 11th hour @MarkWarner has proposed an amendment that would decide which foundational technologies are OK and which are not in crypto. This is disastrous.
brian_armstrong,89434,2021-08-06 18:21:34+00:00,I don't believe she is anti-crypto.
brian_armstrong,89435,2021-08-06 18:21:06+00:00,"They are using @SenatorSinema's name as the third person in support of this, but we're hearing behind the scenes that she has asked to have her name taken off the list.

She should come out and say this publicly, or she'll wind up associated with this anti-crypto move."
brian_armstrong,89436,2021-08-06 18:16:50+00:00,"The number of crypto holders in the U.S. is somewhere between 10 and 50 million. This is becoming a very powerful constituent.

It's surprising to me that Senators like @RobPortman and @MarkWarner are willing to go against this many Americans."
brian_armstrong,89437,2021-08-06 18:13:38+00:00,Just called - was pretty quick and painless. https://t.co/ARGqJ10kn8
brian_armstrong,89438,2021-08-04 22:14:58+00:00,"10/ We also need to ask all senators to remove the language requiring sweeping surveillance of crypto holders.

brian_armstrong,89439,2021-08-04 22:14:50+00:00,"9/ This will not happen without your elected reps hearing from you. Please contact your senators and ask them to support the amendment to the infrastructure bill proposed by @RonWyden, @SenToomey and @SenLummis (which gets us part way there by narrowing the definition of broker)."
brian_armstrong,89440,2021-08-04 22:11:47+00:00,8/ Policymakers play a critical role in ensuring that tech innovation can flourish in the United States. I hope that they keep this in mind and don‚Äôt impose draconian burdens on an industry that will play a major role in the innovative future of our country.
brian_armstrong,89441,2021-08-04 22:10:57+00:00,7/ All we ask for is an even playing field with traditional finance that doesn't penalize cryptocurrency unfairly.
brian_armstrong,89442,2021-08-04 22:10:45+00:00,6/ The infrastructure bill also imposes sweeping and unprecedented reporting requirements that will force exchanges like Coinbase and others to surveil its customer‚Äôs transactions in a way that is more intrusive than the rest of traditional finance (Link: https://t.co/erninsSl0L)
brian_armstrong,89443,2021-08-04 22:10:27+00:00,"5/ Fortunately senators @RonWyden, @SenToomey, @SenLummis have an amendment that narrows the definition to intermediaries like @coinbase, who actually have the capacity to report, just like in the traditional financial system. (Link: https://t.co/h2MqMt7Fsf)"
brian_armstrong,89444,2021-08-04 22:10:14+00:00,"4/ This makes no sense. Smart contracts, for instance, are not companies, and cannot be modified to collect KYC info or issue 1099s. They are simply software running on the blockchain that anyone can use."
brian_armstrong,89445,2021-08-04 22:09:56+00:00,"3/ But the bill defines ‚Äúbrokers‚Äù to include anyone who ‚Äúeffectuates transfers of digital assets.‚Äù This means almost anyone in the crypto ecosystem (miners, validators, smart contracts, open source developers etc) could be treated as a ‚Äúbroker‚Äù with massive reporting obligations."
brian_armstrong,89446,2021-08-04 22:09:21+00:00,"2/ Coinbase is happy to help customers fulfill tax obligations just like the rest of the financial services industry. We've been doing this for years, and issuing more 1099s is a great idea.  https://t.co/CFagI7nnbm"
brian_armstrong,89447,2021-08-04 22:09:14+00:00,"1/ If you‚Äôve been following threads on the Infrastructure bill, you know that there is a hastily conceived provision related to digital assets. This provision could have a profound negative impact on crypto in the US and unintentionally push more innovation offshore."

brian_armstrong,89580,2021-04-14 20:41:48+00:00,24/ Higher economic freedom correlates with the kind of societies that we all aspire to create. Our job at Coinbase is to help make this future a reality.

brian_armstrong,89585,2021-04-14 20:40:28+00:00,19/ The cryptoeconomy today is nothing like the ecosystem that existed when we launched Coinbase 9 years ago. And it‚Äôs nothing like the ecosystem that will exist 9 years from now.

brian_armstrong,89588,2021-04-14 20:39:45+00:00,"16/ But perhaps the most challenging time for Coinbase was in the fall/winter of 2017/18. Fueled by a boom in ICOs, we experienced a surge in trading volumes like nothing we had ever seen before. Virtually overnight, we saw 10x our average volumes."

brian_armstrong,89591,2021-04-14 20:38:59+00:00,13/ Our culture was a unique blend. We identified with early cypherpunks but were also willing to do the work necessary to be a regulated financial services company. We‚Äôd go from meeting banks to anarchists in a day.

brian_armstrong,89598,2021-04-14 20:21:47+00:00,"6/ It‚Äôs hard to overstate how bad of an idea everyone thought Coinbase was. Friends in tech said they didn‚Äôt get it or that it was a scam. I had a lot of self doubt personally, and thought maybe I was crazy for being so interested in it."

brian_armstrong,89600,2021-04-14 20:20:08+00:00,"4/ While the Coinbase app has evolved a lot since then (It was first called Bitbank until I learned that ‚Äúbank‚Äù carries a very specific legal, regulatory definition!), the mission is the same: to increase economic freedom in the world."
brian_armstrong,89601,2021-04-14 20:19:49+00:00,3/ This has driven me ever since as I believe creating more economic freedom is one of the biggest meta problems of our time. It has so many positive downstream effects in society. https://t.co/DuTOX11jif
brian_armstrong,89602,2021-04-14 20:19:35+00:00,"2/ The Coinbase journey started when I read the Satoshi whitepaper while I was home for Thanksgiving in 2010. As I read it, I realized that crypto had the power to unlock a future where economic freedom was a reality for everyone."

Not just because of recent crypto prices (lots rode those), but the early stage companies they invested in. Someone should check....who does leaderboards for such things?"

Btw, Katie is a former federal prosecutor! She would not propose challenging this in court unless she felt there was a strong case. Coinbase intends to join A16Z in challenging this in court, if it goes through. https://t.co/8O6Ayzpnbh"
