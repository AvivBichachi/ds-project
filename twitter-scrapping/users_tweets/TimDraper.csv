6– Congress must abide by all the laws they impose on the American people
 
7– All contracts with past and present Congressman / Woman are void."
TimDraper,121408,2020-07-02 17:39:56+00:00,"3– Congress must purchase their own retirement plan, just as all Americans do.
 
4– Congress will no longer vote themselves pay increases.  Congressional pay will  rise by the lower of CPI or 3%"
TimDraper,121409,2020-07-02 17:39:56+00:00,"2– Congresspeople (past, present &amp; future) participate in Social Security.  All funds in the Congressional Retirement Fund move to the Social Security System immediately.  Congress participates with the  American People.  It may not be used for any other purposes."
TimDraper,121410,2020-07-02 17:39:56+00:00,"This makes sense to me. Congress should live under the laws they create.  The Proposed Congressional Reform Act:

1– No Tenure / No Pension.   A Congressman / Woman, collects a salary while in office and receives no pay when they're out of office.  No more perks go with them."
