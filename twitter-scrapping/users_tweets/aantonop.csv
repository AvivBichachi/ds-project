aantonop,95985,2021-02-22 01:11:01+00:00,"This was the third time they had requested ""addiitonal information"" or audited the API use, even though it was relatively low quota. Each time, a series of low-level agents would punt for weeks on the basis of keywords."

aantonop,97083,2020-12-25 03:46:39+00:00,Information security is a field that creates a *very* strong Dunning-Kruger effect. Those who know a little are utterly unaware of how much there is they don't know. So their confidence is at a zenith when it should not be.

But you can use LN right now if you want. It works pretty well. I have people buying stuff on my shop with LN and yesterday I paid a contractor over LN for a small job."
aantonop,97856,2020-11-30 21:24:43+00:00,"@simplyhansen You should've seen how difficult it was to download stuff over FTP in 1992.

It's the main reason the Internet died."
aantonop,97857,2020-11-30 20:36:39+00:00,"Anyone can make a system cheap and fast. All they do is make it centralized and insecure. 

Of course, they won't tell you about that tradeoff. You won't even see it until someone tries to shut the system down or censor your transactions. 

You'll wish you paid a fee to be free"
aantonop,97858,2020-11-30 20:34:59+00:00,"If you're not choosing priority in a (necessarily) scarce system, then someone else is choosing priority for you. Perhaps they think your application is not important or it is spam. It's either fee markets or software despots. I choose fee markets."
aantonop,97859,2020-11-30 19:57:23+00:00,"If you want to have control over this vital part of the Bitcoin system, you need to carefully choose a wallet that allows you to control these things. A non-custodial wallet where you can set the fee rate, get good estimates and ""bump"" with RBF and CPFP. 

Choose well!"
aantonop,97860,2020-11-30 19:57:22+00:00,"Transaction fees are a complicated topic, but they're part of what makes Bitcoin free and decentralized. No one but you can decide how ""important"" a transaction is. You decide and you tell the miners with your fee choice. 

/19"
aantonop,97861,2020-11-30 19:57:22+00:00,"That also means that sometimes your transaction will get dropped from most places but re-broadcast by nodes that have kept it. That can delay the eventual confirmation/rejection of your Tx, leaving it in limbo longer. 

/18"
aantonop,97862,2020-11-30 19:57:21+00:00,"The queue where transactions are held before confirmation is called ""the mempool"". Thing is however, there is no ""the"" mempool. There is ""a mempool"" on every Bitcoin node. It's a decentralized system. Every node keeps a mempool of waiting transactions. 

/17"
aantonop,97863,2020-11-30 19:57:21+00:00,"That's because the reason the network isn't confirming it is that there are too many transactions queued competing for space. The queue itself is limited in size, so the same thing (congestion) preventing your Tx from confirming is likely to cause it to be dropped faster too.
/16"
aantonop,97864,2020-11-30 19:57:20+00:00,"How long can a transaction stay ""stuck"". If the network remains congested and the fee remains low, it can be up to 14 days before the network drops it and you can see the balance again. ""Up to"" because it usually takes 2-3 days before the network drops your Tx.

/15"
aantonop,97865,2020-11-30 19:57:20+00:00,"The transaction spending hasn't happened until... it has. Before confirmation, you have the money. After confirmation the recipient has the money. A block mined containing your Tx signals the change in state. 

/14"
aantonop,97866,2020-11-30 19:57:20+00:00,"In order to prevent weird user behavior, your wallet will ""hide"" the balance of coins that you have tried to spend with a pending transaction. It will show your balance decreased by that amount. But in reality, the coins are still in your wallet.

/13"
aantonop,97867,2020-11-30 19:57:19+00:00,"Bitcoin transactions are ""atomic"", meaning they are indivisible. The money is not removed from your wallet and sent somewhere before arriving at another wallet. If the transaction isn't confirmed, you have the money. If it is confirmed, the recipient has the money. No limbo

/12"
aantonop,97868,2020-11-30 19:57:19+00:00,"First of all, DON'T PANIC. It's important to understand that in Bitcoin your money can't get lost ""in limbo"". If you create a transaction and it is not getting confirmed, your money is not at risk of being lost. It will either confirm or it won't and your money is safe

/11"
aantonop,97869,2020-11-30 19:57:18+00:00,"Now, you're ready to send a transaction. If you have RBF, pick a low fee and see what happens. Later you can increase the fee and keep increasing it until you get the result you want. But what if you already sent a transaction, without RBF and it got stuck?

/10"
aantonop,97870,2020-11-30 19:57:18+00:00,"Again, good wallets do Replace-By-Fee (RBF) and Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP) to help you manage a congested network and not get your Tx stuck. If your wallet doesn't do those things... consider changing wallets. 

/9"
aantonop,97871,2020-11-30 19:57:17+00:00,"Before sending a transaction you should also check if your wallet supports fee ""bumping"" with RBF or CPFP. If you can later ""bump"" the fee up, you can afford to be cheap at first and see if you get lucky. If you can't bump, you run the risk of getting your Tx stuck. 

/8"
aantonop,97872,2020-11-30 19:57:17+00:00,"If you use a wallet that creates ""legacy"" addresses that start with a ""1"", then choose a different wallet and move your money when the network isn't congested. 

Addresses that start with ""3"" (wrapped Segwit) are better. Those that start with ""bc1"" (native Segwit)  are best

/7"
aantonop,97873,2020-11-30 19:57:16+00:00,"If your wallet doesn't allow you to estimate fees or its fee estimation seems to be too conservative, use a different wallet. Another big reason for high fees is legacy address use. Different bitcoin addresses cost up to 40% less in fees for the sender. 

/6"
aantonop,97874,2020-11-30 19:57:16+00:00,"Some wallets won't let you set the fee rate or confirmation target. Some wallets also estimate fees very conservatively and aggressively overpay fees. That's because if your transaction is stuck you complain to the wallet devs. If you overpay fees you blame the bitcoin devs

/5"
aantonop,97875,2020-11-30 19:57:16+00:00,"At a current fee rate, you might have to pay 0.0002 BTC or so to get your transaction confirmed within 3 blocks. That's for a typical sized transaction. 

/4"
aantonop,97876,2020-11-30 19:57:15+00:00,"Transaction fees are measured in satoshis per virtual byte (vbyte). Different transaction types have different sizes, depending on the complexity, number of inputs/outputs and address type being spent. 

A typical size (one input, two outputs) is about 144 vB. 

/3"
aantonop,97877,2020-11-30 19:57:15+00:00,"First, check and see how congested things are. A great site for this is Johoe's Bitcoin Mempool statistics:

A soft fork allows existing (unapgraded) nodes to continue following the chain: it is a narrowing of the rules.

aantonop,98322,2020-09-21 13:14:57+00:00,"This FinCen leak is worthy of our ridicule because it reveals the hypocrisy of those who argue that crypto-currency is for money launderers. Banking *is* money laundering on a massive scale. But the solution is not to tighten controls on money. That won't work

15/"
aantonop,98323,2020-09-21 13:14:56+00:00,"The only type of money (crypto) that poor, undocumented, oppressed, and controlled populations can use will of course be attacked. But they will not have any choice but to continue to use cryptocurrency. Billions are already unbanked by fiat controls. 

14/"
aantonop,98324,2020-09-21 13:14:56+00:00,"Then the war on cash and the war on ""illicit"" money becomes an all out war on the only money that still works. The free, open, borderless, neutral, immutable, censorship resistant money that crypto-currencies like Bitcoin offer

13/"
aantonop,98325,2020-09-21 13:14:56+00:00,"Open and private crypto-currencies won't comply with these regulations, because they CAN'T comply without breaking every feature and capability they have.

aantonop,98326,2020-09-21 13:14:55+00:00,"That makes crypto-currency a systemic threat, not to the economic nature of national money, but to the control and surveillance system of geopolitical money. Math money doesn't play politics, which makes it automatically ""rogue"" money. 

11/"
aantonop,98327,2020-09-21 13:14:55+00:00,"More and more people will need to use cryptocurrency in order to participate in the global economy, because control-currency doesn't work as money.

aantonop,98328,2020-09-21 13:14:54+00:00,"Then of course, the need and value of open financial systems based on open, private, and uncensorable cryptocurrencies will increase dramatically.

aantonop,98329,2020-09-21 13:14:54+00:00,"These new rules will make government surveillance worse and will erode democratic institutions. They will make it possible for dictators to economically surveil, control, and eventually extinguish any opposition. They will use US surveillance tech to impose financial fascism

6/"

5/"
aantonop,98333,2020-09-21 13:14:52+00:00,"""Worse than Useless"" is the title of a talk I gave about this topic.

4/"
aantonop,98334,2020-09-21 13:14:52+00:00,"I've talked about this extensively.

aantonop,98335,2020-09-21 12:55:16+00:00,"See the correct analysis of this news is that AML/CTF and KYC don't work. They will never work because they try to control the *tool* not the *criminal act*. It's not the money that is illicit, it's the use of that money to commit crimes.

/19"
aantonop,98610,2020-08-10 18:04:50+00:00,"The exact same attitude that I've been battling this same week with a silly article about Bitcoin mining centralization in China, that ignores several key nuances of the Bitcoin system because of a lack of technical understanding or independent review. 

/18"
aantonop,98611,2020-08-10 18:04:49+00:00,"The nuance is what was missed by all the gloating investment ""experts"" who have been jumping up and down for several days, thinking they found a gotcha that invalidates Ethereum. Demonstrating their lack of understanding of the technology and its economics. 

/17"
aantonop,98612,2020-08-10 18:04:48+00:00,"On top of all that you have to scan the blockchain to create a correct current state, based on the mining rewards. All of which means that there is NUANCE to this question. 

/16"
aantonop,98613,2020-08-10 18:04:48+00:00,"Therefore, your methoology for calculating ETH supply will determine your answer.

/15"
aantonop,98614,2020-08-10 18:04:47+00:00,"But just like Bitcoin's mempool, not all nodes see all uncles at the same time, meaning that if you are asking for a real-time snapshot, you will get different answers. That's not because there isn't consensus, it's because consensus on uncles is a few blocks behind the tip. 
/14"
aantonop,98615,2020-08-10 18:04:46+00:00,"The consensus mechanism can count the *exact* issuance of ETH, as long as you set a specific block height that has had all it's uncles counted and use that as a point of reference. 

/13"
aantonop,98616,2020-08-10 17:54:47+00:00,"It's important to understand that uncles arrive with a slight delay from the parent block and are incorporated on an ""eventual"" basis up to 6 blocks after the parent. This means the issuance at any height isn't finalized until a few blocks later, when all uncles are counted. 
/12"
aantonop,98617,2020-08-10 17:54:46+00:00,"Ok I lied, it's 3 purposes - 
(3) The rewarding of uncles reduces the incentive of mining empty blocks, since the race is not winner-takes all. 

/11"
aantonop,98618,2020-08-10 17:54:46+00:00,"(2) It acts as a sort of on-chain mining pool mechanism, since it doesn't penalize second-finish miners with a zero reward. This makes lower-hashrate miners able to compete as solo miners without losing potential reward

/10"
aantonop,98619,2020-08-10 17:54:45+00:00,"This mechanism serves two purposes: 

(1) it allows much faster block times (40x of bitcoin), without creating a whole mess of stale blocks that get no reward. Ethereum doesn't discard stales, it rewards them

/9"
aantonop,98620,2020-08-10 17:48:27+00:00,"This is a critical point to understand: ETH supply issued as rewards doesn't go 100% to the winning block each confirmation. In Ethereum, up to 87% of the block reward goes to uncles, and some is further distributed to nephews (children of uncles). Part also goes to the parent
/8"
aantonop,98621,2020-08-10 17:48:26+00:00,"Then there are ""uncles"". In Bitcoin, PoW is a winner-takes-all mechanism. Not in Ethereum, which uses a Greedy Heaviest Observed Tree (GHOST) protocol to include stale blocks with a lower reward. These are caller ""uncles"" or ""ommers""

/7"
aantonop,98622,2020-08-10 17:44:05+00:00,"Bitcoin does 1 block every 10 minutes. Ethereum does ~40 in that time. So exactly when you ask the question, will determine what answer you get. It won't be a stable answer for 10 minutes, it will change every 15-30 seconds or so. 

/6"
aantonop,98623,2020-08-10 17:44:04+00:00,"Then there's the nuance of burn addresses. Where in Bitcoin there are some assumed burn addresses, there's none universally recognized. In Ethereum however, the 0x0 address (used for contract registration) is in effect a burn address. Do you count that ETH? Some do some don't

/5"
aantonop,98624,2020-08-10 17:44:03+00:00,"There's also the fact that Ethereum uses an account-balance based system instead of a coin-fragment (UTXO) system. That means that counting current ETH in circulation is not as simple as finding all UTXO in Bitcoin. Nevertheless it is possible - you just have to scan the chain
/4"
aantonop,98625,2020-08-10 17:38:53+00:00,"You can easily see how this plays out in Bitcoin too, if you've paid any attention to all the errors in popular blockchain explorers over the years. Take a Bitcoin metric like ""current hashrate"" and you will find a dozen different answers depending on where you look

/3"
aantonop,98626,2020-08-10 17:37:40+00:00,"First of all a block explorer is a very limited view of any blockchain.

aantonop,110108,2015-01-14 04:30:07+00:00,@cal_abel Speeding up the re-targeting algo doesn‚Äôt change the profit calculation at all. Only changes the curve fit

aantonop,110118,2015-01-14 04:11:33+00:00,@BlueMeanie4 Depends on the average electricity rate for the miners. It appears that most mining has migrated to areas of subsidized power
aantonop,110119,2015-01-14 04:10:17+00:00,"@BlueMeanie4 They turn off, difficulty adjusts down, they turn on again"
aantonop,110120,2015-01-14 04:09:55+00:00,@cukeking Most of which have subsidized electricity. Some free even. That might make the mining market more resilient overall
aantonop,110121,2015-01-14 04:08:35+00:00,"@BlueMeanie4 You are aware that the difficulty dynamically adjusts in that scenario, right?"
aantonop,110122,2015-01-14 04:07:49+00:00,@TheGodsKing Doesn‚Äôt work if people are willing to trade. Fixed rates are quickly abandoned as people trade the difference. See arbitrage
aantonop,110123,2015-01-14 04:06:52+00:00,"@BlueMeanie4 No, there are more than 500 startups in this space with thousands of employees. VC owns a small percentage of that industry."
aantonop,110124,2015-01-14 04:04:24+00:00,@BlueMeanie4 The smallest measure of VC money that has poured into bitcoin in two years. Not counting mining hardware

aantonop,115005,2013-11-11 09:23:47+00:00,Bitcoin provides incredible big data for the study of micro-economics in the blockchain transactions and macro-economics in the currency.
aantonop,115006,2013-11-11 09:18:56+00:00,@kurtybot You can start one.

aantonop,115008,2013-11-11 09:10:06+00:00,"Mastercoin is taking an approach like HTTP. It tunnels above bitcoin using the exodus address, then creates a complete layer keyed by opcode"
aantonop,115009,2013-11-11 09:05:48+00:00,Bitcoin's distributed blockchain is like the IP of assets. The Tx script is like TCP. OP_RETURN is port 80. A few other protos there too.
aantonop,115010,2013-11-11 08:54:16+00:00,"OP_RETURN in bitcoin is very much like the port 80 of TCP. It opens the door to an entire layer of apps, no longer resorting to kludges."
aantonop,115011,2013-11-11 08:53:26+00:00,"The new OP_RETURN transaction opcode introduced in bitcoin 0.9 will make meta-coins and new ""apps"" much easier and cleaner to implement."
aantonop,115012,2013-11-11 08:50:31+00:00,"It may seem like a tiny amount, but if you added up all the security deposits and escrow amounts, the % fee is huge. Not on the blockchain."
aantonop,115013,2013-11-11 08:49:29+00:00,Every asset that has counterparty risk has cost from risk. Eg. You pay more for the security deposit on your phone. Not on the blockchain.
aantonop,115014,2013-11-11 08:46:00+00:00,"Unlike legal contracts, transactional contracts on the blockchain are verifiably-spendable, irrevocably-redeemable, no counterparty risk."
aantonop,115015,2013-11-11 08:43:27+00:00,@IQUANTSYSTEMS Of course the biggest quant source of all is the blockchain itself.
aantonop,115016,2013-11-11 08:42:51+00:00,"@IQUANTSYSTEMS Yes, mtgox has historical data on API. So do http://t.co/sStR5queU3 and many other sources."
aantonop,115017,2013-11-11 08:41:27+00:00,A lot of simple things that today require legal contracts can be implemented as transactional contracts on the bitcoin blockchain.
aantonop,115018,2013-11-11 08:40:00+00:00,"Bitcoin removes counterparty risk. If you can validate the transaction requirements, you can spend it. Contracts are irrevocably redeemable."
aantonop,115019,2013-11-11 08:37:56+00:00,"Now that we have a frictionless distributed transaction ledger, many simple contracts that depend on law, can become encoded in transactions"
aantonop,115020,2013-11-11 08:33:16+00:00,"We need to drop coin from the names of things we build on top of bitcoin. It's a protocol, not a coin. The layers above are even less ""coin"""
aantonop,115021,2013-11-11 08:26:04+00:00,"One of Mastercoin's interesting innovations is the use of the ""exodus"" address as a portal to meta-coin. Kinda like port 80 on TCP."
aantonop,115022,2013-11-11 08:19:57+00:00,Many of the amazing features of bitcoin stem from its content-neutrality and endpoint-neutrality. Kind of like early Internet. Any-to-Any
aantonop,115023,2013-11-11 08:14:39+00:00,@01101O10 Many others have talked about autonomous corporations and asset owning agents. I'm simply doing mashup.
aantonop,115024,2013-11-11 08:09:43+00:00,@lightcoin People can consciously build positive and amazingly creative uses for such agents. Autonomous Altruistic Agents. Why not?
aantonop,115025,2013-11-11 08:08:42+00:00,"@dch__ I don't know if it is good or bad. But right now, since the invention, it simply is. Now we adapt to that reality."
aantonop,115026,2013-11-11 08:04:31+00:00,Separating personhood from asset ownership. Bitcoin makes it possible for software agents to own and manage assets autonomously.

aantonop,115053,2013-11-10 10:30:14+00:00,It doesn't matter which of the other 192 currencies you are fleeing or cut out from. Bitcoin will take us all. There's power in numbers.
aantonop,115054,2013-11-10 10:28:39+00:00,You don't have to be stateless to appreciate a stateless currency. Bitcoin is not the 193 currency. It is the first supra-national currency.
aantonop,115055,2013-11-10 10:20:04+00:00,@TeringNering It will show the reality of your national currency's purchasing power if the new economy is built on bitcoin. #FutureTicker
aantonop,115056,2013-11-10 10:18:46+00:00,"@m_erlandsson In principle, bitcoin is quite different from a stock. In the market? In both cases price is mostly noise, less signal, agreed"

aantonop,115071,2013-11-10 09:28:52+00:00,@AllSquareCat @trutherbot It's a very common misconception and a dangerous one. A false sense of anonymity is worse than weak pseudonymity
